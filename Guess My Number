# In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
# The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive).
# The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low?
# Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

while result != 'c':
    if result == 'h':
        high = mid
        mid = (mid + low) // 2
